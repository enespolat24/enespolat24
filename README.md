Hi there! I'm a backend developer with a passion for building scalable and reliable systems. I have experience working with a variety of programming technologies, including Laravel, Node.js , and Go.

While I primarily focus on backend development, I've also taken an interest in DevOps and the ways in which it can help improve software development processes. I believe that by embracing DevOps principles, teams can deliver high-quality software more quickly and with fewer errors.

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me Playing GuitarðŸŽ¸, readingðŸ“š, or listening to my favourite playlistðŸŽ§.
